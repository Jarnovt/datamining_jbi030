# JBI030: Data Mining course material

In this repository, you can find the course material - including *jupyter notebooks* - concerning my lectures 
of Data Mining (JBI030), valid for the Data Science program (TUE/UvT).

In particular, my part of the course will cover: 
 1. Data Preprocessing
 1. Model Selection and Evaluation 
 1. Logistic Regression
 1. Linear/Kernelized SVM
 1. Decision Trees
 1. K-Nearest-Neighbors
 1. Neural Networks 
 1. Ensemble Learning 
 
During the lectures, I will present the theory of the listed models/techniqes. Jupyter notebooks contain the relevant `python`
code needed to run such methods. In particular, we will make use of the `scikit-learn` package (and `Keras`, for the Neural
Networks part). Notice that `scikit-learn` requires the installation of other packages, among which the main ones are: 
 * numpy
 * pandas 
 * matplotlib
 
See the file `requirements.pdf` for further information. 

## Relevant Material
The main reference for the course is the [scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/index.html),
which contains an excellent theoretical introduction to the various methodologies, as well as a detailed technical explanation
of its functions. 

Other suggested readings for more detailed insights are: 
 * [DATA MINING: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/book.html)
 * [Introduction to Statistical Learning - With applications in R](https://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/)
 * [Introuction to Machine Learning with Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introduction-to-machine/9781449369880/)
 * [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)

## Cloning the repository
To clone the repository into your local machine, you can run from terminal: 

`git clone https://github.com/davidevdt/datamining_jbi030` 

New jupyter notebooks related to the correponding course lectures will be progressively added at the end of each class;
to fetch the new lectures into the local folder, place your terminal into the folder directory and type

`git pull`
